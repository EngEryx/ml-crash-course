    "Throughout, you will see **FairAware** tasks, which provide opportunities to contextualize ML processes with respect to fairness. In performing these tasks, you'll identify biases and consider the long-term impact of model predictions if these biases are not addressed."

    "## About the Dataset and Prediction Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll work with the [Adult Census Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income), which is commonly used in machine learning literature. This data was extracted from the [1994 Census bureau database](http://www.census.gov/en.html) by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in the dataset contains the following demographic data for a set of individuals who took part in the 1994 Census:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Features\n",
    "*   `age`: The age of the individual in years.\n",
    "*   `fnlwgt`: The number of individuals the Census Organizations believes that set of observations represents.\n",
    "*   `education_num`:  An enumeration of the categorical representation of education. The higher the number, the higher the education that individual achieved. For example, an `education_num` of `11` represents `Assoc_voc` (associate degree at a vocational school), an `education_num` of `13` represents `Bachelors`, and an `education_num` of `9` represents `HS-grad` (high school graduate).\n",
    "*   `capital_gain`: Capital gain made by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n",
    "*   `capital_loss`: Capital loss mabe by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n",
    "*   `hours_per_week`: Hours worked per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Features\n",
    "*   `workclass`: The individual's type of employer. Examples include: `Private`, `Self-emp-not-inc`, `Self-emp-inc`, `Federal-gov`, `Local-gov`, `State-gov`, `Without-pay`, and `Never-worked`.\n",
    "*   `education`: The highest level of education achieved for that individual.\n",
    "*   `marital_status`: Marital status of the individual. Examples include: `Married-civ-spouse`, `Divorced`, `Never-married`, `Separated`, `Widowed`, `Married-spouse-absent`, and `Married-AF-spouse`.\n",
    "*   `occupation`: The occupation of the individual. Example include: `tech-support`, `Craft-repair`, `Other-service`, `Sales`, `Exec-managerial` and more.\n",
    "*   `relationship`:  The relationship of each individual in a household. Examples include: `Wife`, `Own-child`, `Husband`, `Not-in-family`, `Other-relative`, and `Unmarried`.\n",
    "*   `gender`:  Gender of the individual available only in binary choices: `Female` or `Male`.\n",
    "*   `race`: `White`, `Asian-Pac-Islander`, `Amer-Indian-Eskimo`, `Black`, and `Other`. \n",
    "*   `native_country`: Country of origin of the individual. Examples include: `United-States`, `Cambodia`, `England`, `Puerto-Rico`, `Canada`, `Germany`, `Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc)`, `India`, `Japan`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Task\n",
    "The prediction task is to **determine whether a person makes over $50,000 US Dollar a year.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label\n",
    "*   `income_bracket`: Whether the person makes more than $50,000 US Dollars annually.\n",

    "*   `age` is 16 years or older.\n",
    "*   The adjusted gross income (used to calculate `income_bracket`) is greater than $100 USD annually.\n",
    "*   `fnlwgt` is greater than 0.\n",

Recall from the [Classification module of Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/true-false-positive-negative) that a confusion matrix is a grid that plots predictions vs. ground truth for your model, and tabulates statistics summarizing how often your model made the correct prediction and how often it made the wrong prediction. \n",

    "Let's start by creating a binary confusion matrix for our income-prediction model—binary because our label (`income_bracket`) has only two possible values (`<50K` or `>50K`). We'll define an income of `>50K` as our **positive label**, and an income of `<50k` as our **negative label**.\n",

    "Using default parameters, you may find that the model performs better for female than male. Specifically, in our run, we found that both accuracy and AUC for female (0.9137 and 0.9089, respectively) outperformed male (0.7923 and 0.8549, respectively). What is going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the number of true positives (top-left corner) for female is way lower compared to male (479 to 3822). Recall that in Task #1 we noticed a disproportionately high representation of male in the data set (almost 2-to-1). If you further explore the data set using Facets Dive in Task #2 by setting the color to `income_bracket` and one of the axes to `gender`, then you will also find a disproportionately small number of female examples in the higher income bracket, our positive label. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this is all suggesting is that the model is **overfitting, particuarly with respect to female and lower income bracket**. In other words, this model will not generalize well, particularly with female data, as it does not have enough positive examples for the model to learn from. It is **not doing that much better with male, either, as there is a disproportionately small number of high income bracket compared to low income bracket** — though not nearly as poorly represented as with female.\n",

For example, you may want a very low false positive rate, but a high true positive rate. Or you may want a high precision, but a low recall is okay.  \n",
